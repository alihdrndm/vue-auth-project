# Verified vs assumed

Statements in the specification that were **not** verified against a real system. Each keeps its ID from the specification so it can be traced back. When one is verified (or proved wrong), its entry says so, with the date.

There is no E4 or H3: the specification marks no other item as assumed.

## E1

**Hybrid PDFs are not checked for PDF/A-3 conformance.**

- **What is assumed:** a ZUGFeRD / Factur-X file whose embedded XML is valid can be treated as a valid e-invoice, even though its PDF part is not checked against PDF/A-3.
- **Why:** the check needs veraPDF, a Java tool, which is out of scope.
- **How the code handles it:** `backend/src/einvoice/pdf.py` takes the embedded XML out with `facturx.get_xml_from_pdf(..., check_xsd=False)`; only that XML is validated (`backend/src/einvoice/validate.py`). Nothing inspects the PDF container's conformance. Two corpus files show the effect: `wrongFilename.pdf` and `ZUGFeRD_2_fully_compliant_complete.pdf` are `valid` in Eingang although the corpus files them under `fail` (`docs/DECISIONS.md`, "Corpus `fail` files that are not rejected").
- **What the UI says:** the specification prescribes no text. The validation line names only the rules that ran on the XML.
- **Risk:** a real recipient may reject a non-conformant PDF/A-3 file that Eingang accepts.
- **How to verify:** run veraPDF (profile PDF/A-3b) on the hybrid PDFs of the ZUGFeRD corpus and compare its verdicts with Eingang's.

## E2

**Vercel limits a proxied request body to about 4.5 MB.**

- **What is assumed:** a request that Vercel rewrites to the Railway API (`frontend/vercel.json`, `/api/:path*`) may carry a body of at most about 4.5 MB.
- **Why:** uploads in production pass through that rewrite, so a larger body would fail at Vercel before it reaches the API.
- **How the code handles it:** each file may be at most 4 MB (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES=4194304` in `backend/src/eingang/config.py`), checked while the body is read (`backend/src/invoices/middleware.py`, `backend/src/invoices/uploads.py`; a larger file gets `413 FILE_TOO_LARGE`). The API accepts up to 10 files per request, but the frontend always sends **one file per request**, at most 3 in parallel, each with its own result row (`frontend/src/features/upload/uploadQueue.ts`, `frontend/src/features/upload/sendUpload.ts`).
- **What the UI says:** "PDF or XML, up to 4 MB each, 10 at a time." on the drop zone, and "Larger than 4 MB." on a refused file's row (`frontend/src/features/upload/UploadZone.vue`). The specification prescribes no text about the proxy.
- **Risk:** if the real limit is lower than 4 MB plus the multipart overhead, uploads near 4 MB fail at the proxy.
- **How to verify:** after deploying, upload a file just under 4 MB through the Vercel URL and check it is stored; compare with Vercel's documented request body limit for rewrites.

## E3

**BASIC and EXTENDED are checked against the EN 16931 rules only.**

- **What is assumed:** XSD plus the EN 16931 (CEN) Schematron is a good enough check for Factur-X / ZUGFeRD BASIC and EXTENDED invoices.
- **Why:** the profile-specific Factur-X Schematron is out of scope; the vendored KoSIT configuration contains only the EN 16931 and XRechnung rules.
- **How the code handles it:** `backend/src/einvoice/validate.py` runs the XSD and the EN 16931 rules for BASIC, EN 16931, EXTENDED and XRECHNUNG; it runs the XRechnung rules only for XRechnung 3.x (see E5). MINIMUM and BASIC WL are not EN 16931 invoices and get `not_applicable`. An EXTENDED invoice may therefore show EN 16931 findings that the Factur-X EXTENDED profile allows.
- **What the UI says:** "Checked against EN 16931 rules only." for every validated invoice whose profile is not XRechnung, which covers BASIC, EN 16931 and EXTENDED (`rulesLine` in `frontend/src/features/review-screen/validation.ts`). This matches the text the specification prescribes, with a closing full stop.
- **Risk:** EXTENDED invoices can show errors that are allowed by their profile; BASIC and EXTENDED errors that only the Factur-X rules catch are missed.
- **How to verify:** run the official Factur-X Schematron for BASIC and EXTENDED on the corpus files of those profiles and compare with Eingang's findings. The parity evaluation (`evals/parity.py`) does not cover this, because the KoSIT validator uses the same EN 16931 rules.

## E5

**XRechnung 1.x and 2.x are checked against the EN 16931 rules only.**

- **What is assumed:** XRechnung 1.x and 2.x invoices can be checked with XSD and the EN 16931 rules alone.
- **Why:** the vendored rules are for XRechnung 3.0 (configuration release `v2026-01-31`, XRechnung 3.0.2); applying them to older versions would report rules that did not exist then.
- **How the code handles it:** `backend/src/einvoice/detect.py` reads the version from the specification identifier (BT-24, for example `urn:xoev-de:kosit:standard:xrechnung_2.3` gives profile `XRECHNUNG`, version `2.3`). `backend/src/einvoice/validate.py` runs the XRechnung Schematron only when the version starts with `3`; otherwise the invoice gets XSD and EN 16931 only.
- **What the UI says:** "XRechnung 2.x: checked against EN 16931 rules only." for an XRechnung invoice whose identifier is the older KoSIT standard (`urn:xoev-de:kosit:standard:xrechnung`) or names version 1.x or 2.x (`rulesLine` in `frontend/src/features/review-screen/validation.ts`). This matches the text the specification prescribes, with a closing full stop. The same text is shown for 1.x.
- **Risk:** findings that only the XRechnung 1.x/2.x CIUS rules would raise are missed.
- **How to verify:** validate XRechnung 1.x/2.x invoices with the KoSIT validator and the configuration release made for that XRechnung version and compare with Eingang's findings.

## H1

**The daily maintenance keeps the free Supabase project from pausing; a paused project can be restored for free.**

- **What is assumed:** Supabase Free pauses a project after about a week without activity, a daily database query counts as activity, and restoring a paused project costs nothing.
- **Why:** the public demo runs on Supabase Free; a paused database takes the demo offline.
- **How the code handles it:** the schedule `daily-maintenance` (03:10 UTC, `backend/src/eingang/schedules.py`) runs `MaintenanceWorkflow`, whose last step `log_daily_stats` (`backend/src/eingang/maintenance_activities.py`) counts documents per status in the database.
- **What the UI says:** nothing; `docs/DEPLOY.md` explains how to restore a paused project from the Supabase dashboard, and notes that the maintenance does not run while the services are paused.
- **Risk:** the demo is offline until the owner restores the project.
- **How to verify:** keep the deployment running for more than a week with no visitors and check the project stays active in the Supabase dashboard.

## H2

**Railway's lowest usage hard limit is USD 10 per month.**

- **What is assumed:** Railway lets a workspace set a usage hard limit, the lowest allowed value is USD 10 per month, and Railway stops the services instead of charging more when it is reached.
- **Why:** `docs/DEPLOY.md` step 0 tells the owner to set this limit first, so the monthly bill is capped.
- **How the code handles it:** not in code; it is an account setting. `docs/DEPLOY.md` step 0 also sets a usage email alert at USD 4.
- **What the UI says:** nothing in the app; `docs/DEPLOY.md` step 0 tells the owner to check the page for the current minimum.
- **Risk:** if the minimum is higher, the cap on the bill is higher too.
- **How to verify:** open Railway's workspace usage settings page and read the minimum hard limit before deploying.
