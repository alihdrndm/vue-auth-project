# Costs

Only numbers that were measured here or read from an official price page are in this file. Measurements: the e2e Compose stack (the production Dockerfiles) on the development machine, idle for 5 minutes after one sandbox with the twelve samples was opened; one `docker stats --no-stream` sample, taken on 10 Oct 2026.

## Measured idle use

| Service | Runs on | Memory | CPU |
|---------|---------|-------:|----:|
| `api` (gunicorn, 1 worker, 4 threads) | Railway | 102.1 MiB | 0.11 % |
| `worker` (Temporal worker, SaxonC loaded) | Railway | 286.9 MiB | 0.00 % |
| `temporal` (`temporalio/temporal`, start-dev) | Railway | 99.0 MiB | 4.11 % |
| `db` (PostgreSQL 17) | Supabase in production | 38.7 MiB | 14.96 % (local only) |
| `web` (vite preview) | e2e only; Vercel in production | 62.7 MiB | 0.00 % |

Storage after migrating and opening one sandbox: database **9,615,027 bytes (9.4 MB)**; stored files **972 KB** for one sandbox's twelve samples and their derived files.

CPU is the share of one core in that single sample; the Temporal figure includes its own polling and is a snapshot, not an average.

## Railway

Prices from https://railway.com/pricing, read on 10 Oct 2026: memory $0.00000386 per GB per second (about $10 per GB per month), CPU $0.00000772 per vCPU per second (about $20 per vCPU per month), egress $0.05 per GB, volumes $0.15 per GB per month. Hobby plan: $5 per month, including $5 of usage.

Estimate for this project, always on, from the measurements above (memory converted from MiB to GB):

| Service | Memory cost / month | CPU cost / month |
|---------|--------------------:|-----------------:|
| api | 0.0997 GB × $10 = $1.00 | 0.0011 vCPU × $20 = $0.02 |
| worker | 0.2802 GB × $10 = $2.80 | 0.0000 vCPU × $20 = $0.00 |
| temporal | 0.0967 GB × $10 = $0.97 | 0.0411 vCPU × $20 = $0.82 |
| **Total** | **$4.77** | **$0.84** |

About **$5.61 per month** of usage when all three services run all month. The Temporal volume (its SQLite file) is small; volume storage at $0.15 per GB is not measured separately. Egress is not measured.

The scheduled work (one maintenance run per day, a few sandbox seeds per day) was not measured separately; at these sizes it adds seconds of CPU per day.

**Stop rule (HANDOFF "Deployment"):** this estimate is above $4.50 per month on its own, before any other service the owner already runs on Railway. The default is to keep the three services **paused** except while the owner is using the deployed app (`docs/DEPLOY.md`, "Pausing services"). Other options: share one Temporal server with another project, or deploy only for demos.

## Supabase

Free plan, from https://supabase.com/pricing (10 Oct 2026): 500 MB database per project, 1 GB file storage, 5 GB egress, projects paused after 1 week of inactivity, at most 2 active free projects.

Measured: 9.4 MB of database and 972 KB of files per sandbox. Sandboxes are deleted after 24 hours by the daily maintenance, so the free limits are far away at demo use.

## Vercel

The frontend is a static build behind Vercel's rewrites; it runs on Vercel's free (Hobby) tier. No usage has been measured yet.

## OpenAI

Total live spend recorded in the ledger so far: **$0.00** (no live call has been made; `uv run poe llm-spend` prints the current total). The budgets are in `docs/DEPLOY.md` and `HANDOFF.md`: $2.00 lifetime per project, $1.50 per month, $0.10 per day for public demo use, 3 calls per sandbox. Estimates shown before the paid steps (gpt-5-nano prices, $0.05 input / $0.005 cached / $0.40 output per million tokens):

| Step | Estimated maximum |
|------|------------------:|
| Smoke call (`uv run poe llm-smoke`, 3 calls) | $0.0015 |
| Sample precompute (`uv run poe precompute-samples`) | $0.0013 (≈ $0 from the cache after the smoke call) |
| Evaluation run (`uv run poe eval-llm`, 104 documents) | printed by the tool before it starts; capped at $0.75 |

This file is updated with the real spend after each paid step.
